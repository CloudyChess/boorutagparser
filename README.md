# boorutagparser
Copy current post tags and rating on boorus and illustration2vec in to the clipboard for easy import in to a program or another booru.

## How to use
When on a booru post or I2V, a button will appear in the top right to copy all image tags including the rating. You can also press the ] key (I have it bound to a button on my mouse, feel free to change it). The tags will go in to your clipboard and a sound will play to signify success. This is great for importing the tags in to a tagging program like Hydrus Network or another booru.
